# Matplotlib_session-
Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. These visualizations are created to explore and analyze different datasets, showcasing insights through plots, charts, and graphs.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running notebooks)
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Pandas
NumPy
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/data-visualization.git
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy
Usage
Running Python Scripts
You can run individual Python scripts to generate specific visualizations. For example:

bash
Copy code
python bar_chart.py
Running Jupyter Notebooks
If you prefer using Jupyter notebooks, start Jupyter in the repository directory:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Navigate to the notebook of interest (e.g., scatter_plot.ipynb) and execute the cells to see the visualizations.

Contents
bar_chart.py: Demonstrates creating bar charts using Matplotlib.
scatter_plot.ipynb: Shows scatter plots with regression lines using Seaborn.
line_plot.py: Generates line plots over time using Matplotlib.
heatmap.ipynb: Illustrates heatmaps for correlation analysis using Seaborn.
pie_chart.py: Creates a pie chart for categorical data visualization.
README.md: This file, containing project description, installation instructions, and usage details.
